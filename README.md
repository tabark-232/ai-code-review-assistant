AI-powered assistant for code review, analysis, and bug fixing — built with GPT and Gradio.
AI Code Review Assistant
A smart, interactive tool for automated code analysis and improvement using GPT-3.5.
 What it does:

AI Code Review Assistant allows developers to input code via text, file, or URL and automatically:

    🔤 Detects the programming language

    📋 Analyzes code for issues and improvements

    🛠 Suggests or applies fixes

    🧪 Performs logical testing of the fixed code

Built using Python, Gradio, and the OpenAI API, this project streamlines code review into a single, user-friendly interface.
💼 Business Value

This tool is especially valuable for software development teams, startups, and tech companies that aim to:

    ⚡ Speed up code reviews by catching basic issues early

    🧪 Improve code quality with AI-powered insights

    👨‍💻 Support junior developers with real-time feedback

    🤝 Enhance team collaboration, especially in remote or distributed teams

    🔁 Integrate into CI/CD pipelines as a pre-review or quality gate step

Compared to static code analyzers, this assistant leverages the reasoning ability of GPT to understand logic, suggest refactoring, and provide better human-like review feedback.
